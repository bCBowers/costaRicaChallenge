# costaRicaChallenge

This project is a solution to the Costa Rican Household Poverty Prediction Challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction. My work in this challenge includes a pre-processing function and then a Light Gradient Boosting model with stratified 5-fold cross-validation. As of 7/30, I'm in 16th place out of 203 teams and I'm currently working alone.


The individual models were developed with the help of kernels from Kaggle.
